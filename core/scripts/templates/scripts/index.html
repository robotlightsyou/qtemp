        <h2><strong>welcome to the applescript tutorial</strong></h2>
        <p>In the beginning there was the work of others. Smarter, more experinced people 
        that came before and shared their knowledge. I started with simple scripts that filled
        needs missing in the production release of QLab. After reading a few and integrating them  
        into my workflow the day came when I needed something new. 
        </p>
        <p>First I tried opening the editor and making something of my own. This was scary and 
        I didn't really nderstand the moving pieces, and I failed miserably. The next time I needed something 
        I decided to try and hack one of the scripts I already had. I changed a few variables, 
        values, and properties, et voila - I had a new tool. This was the beginning of a 
        bountiful relationship.</p>
        <p>That was 5 years ago. Since then I've discovered a number of great resources, 
        and built my own template file to improve my everyday workflow. This site serves as a walkthrough of 
        that file, as well as a guide to learn how to hack together applescripts to fill 
        the specific needs of your venue.</p>
