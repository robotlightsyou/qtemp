        <h3>the script editor</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>This site focuses on adapting existing code into new tools to suit individual needs.
        On this page we'll walk through some of the common resources from writing scripts.
        The primary tools are the script editor and the library. Let's take a look at those.</p>
        <div>
            <img src="{% static "media/tutes/howto/empty_editor.png" %}" alt="img could not load" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
        <p>Here we see an empty script editor(in dark mmode). At the top are seveal buttons. I encourage
        you to explore them fully, however we will only be using Play, Compile, and potentially Stop. 
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <div>
            <img src="{% static "media/tutes/howto/play_buttons.png" %}" alt="img could not load" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block">
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <p>At the bottom of the editor there are three icons on the left side. The third option is to show or hide log.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <div >
            <img src="{% static "media/tutes/howto/log.png" %}" alt="img could not load" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block">
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <p>When we show the log we get some additional options in the middle of the editor. 
        The only one I ever use is Events, and I always use it. This gives a 
        detailed log of every action taken in the execution of a script, handy for debugging.</p>
        <div>
            <img src="{% static "media/tutes/howto/events.png" %}" alt="img could not load" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block">
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <p>Now you're ready to start typing. The large box on the top half of the window
        is for inputting your script. Once you have completed you can press the hammer button
        to compile, or use the <span style="color:#F39C12;font-weight:bold">CMD+K</span> keyboard shortcut. If you don't receive any errors you're ready 
        run the script using the play button, or the <span style="color:#F39C12;font-weight:bold">CMD+R</span> keyboard shortcut. </p>
        <p></p>

        <p></p>
        <h3>the library</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>Included with the script editor is the library. Navigate to the Windows
        menu of the editor and select Library from the dropdown to view it. Or use the 
        keyboard shortcut <span style="color:#F39C12;font-weight:bold">SHIFT+CMD+L</span></p>
        <p></p>
        <div>
            <img src="{% static "media/tutes/howto/library.png" %}" alt="img could not load" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block">
        </div>        
        <p></p>
        <p>With a basic understanding of what you're looking at, we're now
        ready to start hacking with a script. As we go through our exercises we'll
        cover the component parts, how to modify, and even how to write simple scripts from scratch.</p>
